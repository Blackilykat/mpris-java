100% Pure java implementation of MPRIS (MPRIS D-Bus Interface Specification)

Taken from the freedesktop.org site:

The Media Player Remote Interfacing Specification is a standard D-Bus interface which aims to provide a common programmatic API for controlling media players.

It provides a mechanism for discovery, querying and basic playback control of compliant media players, as well as a tracklist interface which is used to add context to the active media item.
